# Login Fix Test Suite

This test suite verifies that the login redirect issue has been resolved with the fixed prefetch implementation.

## Test Coverage

The test suite includes the following test cases:

1. **Admin user login test** - Verifies that admin users can log in successfully and are redirected to the admin dashboard
2. **Regular user login test** - Verifies that regular users can log in successfully and are redirected to the user dashboard
3. **Prefetch TypeError test** - Verifies that the TypeError no longer occurs when calling prefetch
4. **Admin redirect test** - Verifies that admin users are properly redirected to /admin after login
5. **User redirect test** - Verifies that regular users are properly redirected to /user after login
6. **Admin route protection test** - Verifies that admin route protection is still working
7. **Prefetch error handling test** - Verifies that prefetch operations work correctly with the new implementation
8. **Avatar preloading test** - Verifies that avatar images are preloaded when available
9. **Error handling test** - Verifies that errors during login success flow are handled gracefully
10. **Complete login flow test** - Verifies the complete login flow with error scenarios

## Key Improvements Verified

- Prefetch operations no longer throw TypeError
- Admin users are redirected to /admin dashboard
- Regular users are redirected to /user dashboard
- Admin route protection is working correctly
- Prefetch errors are handled gracefully
- Avatar images are preloaded when available

## Running the Tests

### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run the test suite with the following command:

```bash
node run-login-tests.js
```

### Option 2: Using Jest

If you have Jest installed, you can run the tests directly:

```bash
npx jest test-login-fix.js
```

### Option 3: Manual Testing

You can also run the tests manually by importing the test functions in your code:

```javascript
import { runTests } from './test-login-fix.js';

runTests();
```

## Test Implementation Details

The test suite includes:

- **Mock implementations** for Supabase auth, tRPC client, and React Query
- **Test utility functions** to create mock profiles and login responses
- **Comprehensive test cases** covering all aspects of the login flow
- **Error handling verification** to ensure robustness

## Files

- `test-login-fix.js` - The main test file containing all test cases
- `run-login-tests.js` - A simple test runner for Node.js
- `test-login-fix-README.md` - This documentation file

## Understanding the Fix

The original issue was that the prefetch operations in the login form were causing a TypeError. The fix involved:

1. Using React Query's `prefetchQuery` method instead of direct tRPC calls
2. Adding proper error handling around prefetch operations
3. Ensuring that prefetch failures don't prevent the login redirect
4. Implementing proper role-based redirects after successful login

The test suite verifies that all these aspects are working correctly.
